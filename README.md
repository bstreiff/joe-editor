# joe-editor

This is an unofficial fork of the joe-editor mercurial repository:
- https://sourceforge.net/p/joe-editor/mercurial/ci/default/tree/

I converted this to `git` using `hg-fast-export`:
- https://github.com/frej/fast-export

This was mostly because I'm stubborn and didn't want to learn `hg` syntax,
but I wanted to experiment with some features.

As tempting as GitHub's "Fork your own copy" functionality may be, I would
urge you to not do so with this repo and suggest you work with upstream
directly, either in `hg` or by `hg-fast-export`ing your own copy. (If an
official `git` mirror exists in the future, I am likely to delete this
repo and replace it with a `git clone` of that one.)
